feat: Add startup on boot setting

This commit introduces a new setting that allows the application to start automatically when the user logs into Windows.

- A "Start with Windows" checkbox has been added to the settings window.
- When enabled, a batch file is created in the user's Startup folder to launch the application.
- The setting is saved in `settings.json` and applied on application start.
